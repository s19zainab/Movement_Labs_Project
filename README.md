Movement Labs Project

I analyzed a dataset for Movement Labs, who I interned with. They are a consulting firm that leverages technology to enhance 
progressive power and electoral strategies, focusing on voter engagement and campaign tactics.

I analyzed campaign data to inform marketing strategies. It involved cleaning the data to ensure accuracy, bucketing assignment scores, 
and visualizing the relationship between these scores and the percentage of wrong numbers using various charts and plots. 
The results helped to understand the effectiveness of different score ranges and their impact on contact accuracy.
